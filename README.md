libshamir
=========

An implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing in GF(256) with an emphasis on simplicity and readability.

This is derived from [libgfshare](http://www.digital-scurf.org/software/libgfshare). Though almost no code is shared, I consider this a derivative work and have given attribution to Daniel Silverstone, Simon McVittie and Mark D. Wooding.
